# **Assignment 6 - Web Crawler**

This assignment involved creating a knowledge base by web-scraping a webpage of our choosing, getting relevant links off of the webpage, and scraping each of those links for information on a topic for use in the knowledge base.

*Run Instructions:* 
- Open command prompt into the directory where the .py file is. 
- Use the command 'python ScrapeWebpage.py' first. This will run the program that gets relevant links from the webpage of our choosing, and scrapes information off those relevant links.
    - It'll save the raw text to a file in the 'output' folder.
    - You can edit the program to change the data folder location, and names of the files to use. 
- Use the command 'python BuildKB.py' after running the first program. This will use the files generated by the first program in the /output folder to create the knowledge base. 
    - You can edit the program to change the data and output folder location, as well as the names of the files to use.
