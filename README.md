## **Assignment 1 - Text Processing with Python**

This simple assignment involved processing through a text file using regex pattern checks. It also had us try out object creation and serialization in python.

You can view the assignment 1 directory [here](Assignment%201%20-%20Text%20Processing%20with%20Python).

*Run Instructions:* <br/>
• Open command prompt into the directory where the .py file is. <br/>
• Use the command 'python TextProcessing.py data.csv' to run the program. <br/>
    • You can replace 'data.csv' with the path to any file of your choosing. It should follow a similar format as the provided data.csv file, though.

## **Assignment 2 - Word Guessing Game**

This assignment involved tokenizing words from a text file, extracting the nouns, and using the extracted nouns as words for a word guessing game. The preprocessing runs through the terminal, however I'd designed a simple GUI to play the word guessing game through.

You can view the assignment 2 directory [here](Assignment%202%20-%20Word%20Guessing%20Game).

*Run Instructions:* <br/>
• Open command prompt into the directory where the .py file is. <br/>
• Use the command 'python WordGuessingGame.py anat19.txt' to run the program. <br/>
    • You can replace 'anat19.txt' with the path to any file of your choosing. It should be a file that consists of various words and sentences.<br/>
• Once the preprocessing finishes, you can begin playing the word guessing game. Various details about the processed tokens will be outputted to the console, along with the words the game will be using (the top 50 ost commons nouns).

## **Assignment 3 - WordNet**

This assignment involved exploring the WordNet and SentiWordNet APIs of the NLTK library. Specifically, we explore word relations/hierarchies, sentiment scoring, and collocation identification.

You can view the assignment directory [here](Assignment%203%20-%20WordNet).
