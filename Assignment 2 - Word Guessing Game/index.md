# **Assignment 2 - Word Guessing Game**

This assignment involved tokenizing words from a text file, extracting the nouns, and using the extracted nouns as words for a word guessing game. The preprocessing runs through the terminal, however I'd designed a simple GUI to play the word guessing game through.

*Run Instructions:*
- Open command prompt into the directory where the .py file is.
- Use the command 'python WordGuessingGame.py anat19.txt' to run the program.
    - You can replace 'anat19.txt' with the path to any file of your choosing. It should be a file that consists of various words and sentences.
- Once the preprocessing finishes, you can begin playing the word guessing game. Various details about the processed tokens will be outputted to the console, along with the words the game will be using (the top 50 ost commons nouns).

*Notable File(s):* 
- [Code](/WordGuessingGame.py) 
- [Data File](/anat19.txt)
