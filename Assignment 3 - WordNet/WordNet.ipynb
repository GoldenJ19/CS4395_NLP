    "WordNet is a project started by Princeton University that was designed to hierarchically organize grammar in sentences. It provides short definitions, synonym sets, usage examples, and word relations to all sorts of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in the dictionary. As you can imagine, this can be very helpful to those wishing to explore natural language in their projects."

    "In WordNet, Synsets are Synonym Sets, which can be used to view specific definitions about a particular word. You'll notice that with most words, there are multiple synsets for the word, largely because most words have multiple definitions. These synsets are connected to other synsets semantically, giving a sort-of hierarchy to the word structure.\n",
