# **Overview**

This is a repository (sub-portfolio) containing all the programs created for the class, Human Language Technologies (AKA Natural Language Processing) during my 4th year of college.

The portfolio displays my understanding/ability to perform the following Natural Language Processing (+ any computer science-related skills) skills:
- Text Processing
- Sentence Parsing
- N-Gram Structure
- Sentence Tokenization
- Language Models
- Web Scraping
- Machine Learning
    - Supervised Learning for Regression & Classification Problems
    - Neural Networks
    - Deep Learning
- Regex
- Git

As well as the following soft skills:
- Time Management
- Flexibility
- Competency to Work Independently
- Ability to Contribute Meaningfully to Group Work
- Problem Solving / Critical Thinking

In reflection, CS 4395 had taught me alot about how Natural Language Processing/Understanding works. Most notably, it was really interesting to learn about where we stand currently in relation to AI with the recent release of ChatGPT, and how the future of NLP in the context of AI is looking. The class not only inspired me to encorporate some NLP concepts into my future personal projects, but also to keep but with any and all developments relating to the field. I'm not one hundred percent sure that I'll ever commit to a job that focuses specifically on this field, but this class has definitely opened my mind up to the possiblity of pursuing this career path in the future, largely due to interconnected NLP is with other fields.
